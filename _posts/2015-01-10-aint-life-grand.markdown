Playing With Markdown
---------------------

Here we are, playing with markdown 

Below is an unordered list: 

  * This is list item.
     * This is a nested list item.
       * This is nested list item under a nested list item. Easy. Derp.

    A link is bracketed _name_ parenthesized **url**

    Code may be displayed with four spaces, apparently. But this blog appears to use GFM of four backticks.
